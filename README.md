# ffmpeg-scripts
A collection of â€˜ffmpeg' scripts that I collected during my work on multimedia productions.

# How to use
These scripts requires `ffmpeg` installed on your computer and `bin` path set using environment variables.
So grab fresh `ffmpeg` from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows.
After installing, make sure that executing `ffmpeg` inside commandline correctly recognizes the command.

To make these scripts practical, I put them inside **SendTo** directory, so I can right click on any file and send it to chosen script. The easiest way to open **SendTo** directory is to type `shell:sendto` in Windows Explorer and click Enter.
